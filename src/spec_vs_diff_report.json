  "summary": "Brand text and header logo usage were updated to “Josh” in the main layout, and the HTML document title was changed to “Josh”. However, the diff does not show the new logo asset being added under the required public assets path, does not show any production deployment/subdomain configuration change to `josh`, and provides no evidence that all remaining user-facing “Threads” references across the UI were removed.",

      "reason": "The header now references `/assets/generated/josh-logo.dim_512x512.png` with appropriate alt text, but no new image file was added in the diff (Added files: none), so there is no evidence the required asset exists under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`.",
